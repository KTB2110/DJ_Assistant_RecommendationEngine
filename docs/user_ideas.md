A running list of feature ideas and UI concepts for the DJ Assistant project.

## Idea #1: Genre Suggestion Button
**Date:** December 18, 2025

**Description:** 
- UI button: "Suggest genres to mix into"
- Shows 10 closest genres based on distance matrix
- Display the distance metric alongside each genre (transparency for the user)

**Notes:**
- Some unexpected matches might actually work well for creative mixing
- Distance metric helps user understand *why* a genre was suggested

## Idea #2: Advanced Mode Feature Dials
**Date:** December 18, 2025

**Description:**
- Toggle between Simple Mode (master dial) and Advanced Mode (per-feature dials)
- Simple Mode: One dial controls energy (Build/Maintain/Drop)
- Advanced Mode: Individual dials for each audio feature
- Features: energy, danceability, valence, tempo, loudness, acousticness, instrumentalness, speechiness, liveness

**Notes:**
- Need to decide default behavior for untouched features in Advanced Mode
- Need scoring logic to combine multiple feature directions
